User Interface: Finally, we built a user-friendly interface where users can input car details, and the model returns a predicted price. This interface allows users to get an estimated market price for a car based on similar listings.

This repository contains all necessary code files, including the web scraper, data processing scripts, the machine learning model, and a Flask-based application for easy access to price predictions.
